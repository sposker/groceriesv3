# Grocery List App
This project was created to help my dad make grocery lists. He is getting older and I help out by picking up his groceries. It seemed that his lists were becoming more disorganized and he was forgetting things more frequently, so I created this program that displays options and organizes the list for me. This project is still WIP.

There are two main versions of the app-- windows and android-- both based on the Kivy framework. The lists are primarily constructed on desktop, but my dad wanted the ability to create or edit the list while looking inside the fridge. There is also a database access app for managing items, stores, locations, etc.

Features include loading a list in progress by default with the ability to load previous lists, automatic updating of item notes and default values, automatic sorting during list construction, a search bar with predictive text, an interface for adding new items, automatically merging lists from multiple sources, and more!
